    <p>HI, My name is Nadir. this is my <strong>first</strong> personal html project. I started learning html just recently and i've been realy enjoying it so far, I stll have a lot of things to learn and i am fully aware that the road ahead is very hard but I am ready and super excited to dig into it.
       so my first project is about me! Why? Well, I tried to think of other ideas, this head is <em>empty.</em> this was my Ted talk so let's start.
